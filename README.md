# Toyota-Innovation-Challenge-Automated-Sticker-Detection
Developed an automated system for analyzing the coverage of circular stickers over holes within images. Utilized OpenCV to prepare initial image through contrast adjustment and median blur. Utilized OpenCV to process the image with Canny edge detection and Hough Circle Transform to detect circles. Employing Matplotlib for visual representations of stickers and for further analysis on sticker coverage.
